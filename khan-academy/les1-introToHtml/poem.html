    <h1>Your Best</h1>
    <p>
If you always try your best<br>
Then you'll never have to wonder<br> About what you could have done<br>
If you'd summoned all your thunder.<br>
And if your best Was not as good<br>
As you hoped it would be, <br>
You still could say,<br>
"I gave today
All that I had in me."</p>
