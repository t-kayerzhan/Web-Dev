    /*
    A primitive
Is a value of a primitive type.
There are 7 primitive types: string, number, bigint, boolean, symbol, null and undefined.
    
    An object
Is capable of storing multiple values as properties.
Can be created with {}, for instance: {name: "John", age: 30}. 
There are other kinds of objects in JavaScript: functions, for example, are objects.

    let john = {
        name: "John",
        sayHi: function() {
            alert("Hi Buddy!");
        }
    };
    john.sayHi();

    //Constructors String/Number/Boolean are for internal use only
    //in JS explicit create of "wrapper objects" for primitives is
    //possible but NOT reccommended!!
    alert(typeof(0)); //num
    alert(typeof new Number(0)); //obj - they are always truthy
    //However using them to convert a value to another data type is VALID:
    let num = Number("123");
    // null and undefined - DONT HAVE METHODS AND WRAPPER OBJECTS


    //TASK - can i add a string property?
    let str = "Hello";
    str.test = 5;
    alert(str.test); // nothing will be shown (undefined)
